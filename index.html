                <h2> About Me! </h2>
                <p>
                  Hey! My name is Cody, I'm a web and server side application developer,
                  I was born in 1998 in Vigo, Galicia, Spain, but I moved to Barcelona in the year 2000.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Things were boring for a while, went through pre-school, middle school and highschool, and
                  now I'm studying a superior degree in Web development and server side applications, which
                  is amazing if it werent because we're forced to study unrelated stuff all of the time...
                </p>
                <p>
                  During pre-school my favourite subject was art, but then that changed to history at the beggining of
                  middle school, and after that I really liked Science, I was never interested in English until
                  highschool, I had an awesome teacher that gave me the motivation I needed to
                  learn English, which completely changed my life, I now have friends from all over the world, I tweet in English,
                  I have all my electronics in English and I even type in English, I use EN (UK) keyboard, which is usually
                  annoying to teachers and class mates because they're used to using ES (ES), which is quite different hehe.
                </p>

                    <h3>Obscure</h3>
                    <p>
                      Obscure is an intelectual puzzle game, the objective is to beat all the levels, the only final reward is to beat
                      the game, when someone does that, the entire game will remove itself, only one person can
                      complete all 20 levels and to do so they will need to be very skilled in many different fields.

                    <h3>Nerve</h3>
                    <p>
                      Nerve is an anonymous chat made in PHP, with a json database, it's sort of like 4chan but built
                      to be a chat-like environment with images instead of an imageboard, could also be used as just
                      a chat engine thanks to it's open json database.
